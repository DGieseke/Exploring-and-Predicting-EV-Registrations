# Exploring and Predicting EV Registrations
*Daniel Gieseke  |  August 3, 2023*

## Overview
The electric vehicle (EV) industry is booming.  Whether it be at the automotive manufacturer level or within the EV charging space, EVs are becoming the new focus of the automotive industry.  With this growth and focus, companies and public sector agencies alike are striving to understand the markets purchasing and adopting EVs within the United States (US).  This project aims to understand the socioeconomic features that affect EV adoption in the US with the goal of capturing the markets currently adopting EVs, and better understanding how to pivot strategies to encourage EV adoption in slower-growing markets.
